# Welcome to my Personal Site :)

This site was created using the javascript version of create react app, and styled with MUI and bootstrap components. I designed this site to showcase my technical experience whilst incorporating my own interests and hobbies as well. I've also left an easter egg in the site, so keep an eye out for a hidden surprise!
